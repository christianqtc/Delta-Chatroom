# README for CS3410 #

### Project Proposal ###

For the project we will implement a chat board application in Java with UI, backend and multi-user interface to consider. We will have a board where we would have multiple users chat simultaneously. We would also use a login/password encrypted authentication on the backend. The chat server would accept RESTful API call to change and present data. Initial version will only accept text input with no attachments.
